# odin-recipes

Hello! My name is Ruby-YSY and this project is Odin Recipes, a website where I'll post my favorite meals!
Just kidding, this project is tutorial-based and used as my programming practice. 

Here are the skills I learned so far:

- Bash
- Git and how to commit changes
- HTML Boilerplate
- Adding text
- Adding lists
- Adding links and images
